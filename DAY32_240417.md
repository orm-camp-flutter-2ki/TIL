# 클린 아키텍쳐 (Clean Architecture)
##### - 로버트 C. 마틴

> Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob." It provides a structured way of organizing code, focusing on separation of concerns and maintaining the independence of components. The main goal of Clean Architecture is to create systems that are flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain over time.  
> "결국 클린 아키텍쳐의 목적은, 유연하고, 확장가능하며, 유지관리가 편한 시스템을 만드는 것입니다."

##### The key principles of Clean Architecture include:

> Independence of Frameworks: The core business logic should not be dependent on any specific external framework or technology. Frameworks are implementation details and should be kept separate from the business logic.
Testability: The architecture should support easy testing of each component in isolation, without requiring the presence of external dependencies or infrastructure.
Independence of UI: The user interface (UI) should be isolated from the business logic. This allows for changes in the UI without affecting the underlying business rules, and vice versa.
Independence of Database: Similar to the UI, the database should be isolated from the business logic. This allows for flexibility in choosing different database technologies or making changes to the database schema without impacting the core business logic.
Separation of Concerns: The system should be divided into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific concern. Commonly, these layers include the presentation layer (UI), application layer (business logic), domain layer (core business rules), and infrastructure layer (external interfaces such as databases and frameworks).
Dependency Rule: Dependencies should always point inwards towards the core of the application. This means that higher-level layers should not depend on lower-level layers, and all dependencies should flow towards the core domain logic.
Use Cases: The application should be organized around the use cases or user stories, focusing on what the system needs to accomplish from the user's perspective.
Clean Architecture Diagram: Martin proposes a diagram that visualizes the layers and their dependencies, with the core domain logic at the center and external frameworks at the outer layers.
Clean Architecture is technology-agnostic and can be applied to various programming languages and platforms. It promotes a modular and flexible approach to software development, which ultimately leads to more maintainable and sustainable systems.

### BOTTOMNAVIGATIONBAR
##### Live Templete
```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
  currentIndex: 0, //선택된 Tab
  //currentIndex: _currentIndex, // int _currentIndex = 0;
  onTap: (index){
    setState((){
      _currentIndex = index;
    }):
  }, //선택된 index값을 현재 화면에 띄움.
  items: const [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'home'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'MyProfile'),
  ],
),
```
##### 1) BottomNavigationBar & Tab 활용하기
##### (A) BottomNavigationBar 생성
```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
  currentIndex: 0, //선택된 Tab
  items: const [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'home'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'MyProfile'),
  ],
),
```
##### (B) currentIndex:에 변수 연결
```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
  currentIndex: _currentIndex,
  items: const [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'home'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'MyProfile'),
  ],
),
```
##### (C) onTap: 설정
```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
  currentIndex: _currentIndex,
  onTap: (index) {
    setState(() {
      _currentIndex = index;
    });
  },
  items: const [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'home'),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'MyProfile'),
  ],
),
```
##### (D) 화면 변경을 위한 리스트 생성

```dart
...
class _TabPageState extends State<TabPage> {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  final _pages = [
    HomePage(),
    SearchPage(),
    AccountPage(),
  ];
...
}
```
##### (E) TabPage의 body에 페이지 연결

```dart
class TabPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const TabPage({super.key});
  ...
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: _pages[_currentIndex], //화면 전환
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
      ...
}
```
